# ContextAudioFeaturesAnalysis
Analysis of the correlation between contextual conditions and audio features extracted from public playlists from Spotify. <br />
For each available contextual condition, the same approach is used in order to analyze its audio features. The first step is to look up and select publicly available playlists that are either created by Spotify or one of its users. These playlists all are related to the given condition, e.g. "Songs for sleeping" for sleeping or "Sad Beats" for sad. Since everyone can just create public playlists, only playlists with at least 1000 followers are selected. This increases the confidence that the songs in these playlists are actually representative for the specific contextual condition, since so many other users agree. 
For each contextual dimension a total of at least 500 unique songs are gathered, extracted from at least 4 different playlists. After collecting these songs, all audio features are extracted, as described above, for each of the songs. These audio features are then used to perform an independent t-test, which are described in more detail in the sub-section below. The average value for each audio feature, based on these 500+ songs, are used in the visualizations.
